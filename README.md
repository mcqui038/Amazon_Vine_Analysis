# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
For this challenge we used pyspark to analyze Amazon product reviews. I chose to analyze the Toys category. 

## Results
### Total Reviews
- Vine: 1218
-  Non-Vine: 64653
### 5-Star Reviews
- Vine: 410
- Non-Vine: 28836
### Percentage of 5-Star Reviews
- Vine: 34%
- Non-Vine: 44%

## Summary
The vine program produced 34% 5-star reviews; whereas the non-vine reviews produced 44% 5-star reviews. Based on this analysis there is not a significant positivity bias for vine reviewers. Another way to look for positivity bias among vine reviewers is to look at the comparision of vine and non-vine reviews for specific products.
